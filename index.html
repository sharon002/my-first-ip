                class
                eight,then i next joined cardinal otunga girls high school in Bungoma kenya for my form one to form four
                education then later on enrolled to Eldoret National Polytechnic where i studied computer science. it
                was
                very shallow,i learned VB and pascal which makes me very annoyed because i dont hear people mentioning
                it
                now days. i just feel it was a waste of time.Now at moringa school hoping to be a great software
                developer
